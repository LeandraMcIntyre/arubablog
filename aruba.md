The summer of 2019 was the summer of *finallys*. Finally attending my first wedding, finally turning 25, and *finally* going on my first real adult vacation.

## Feeling at home 3,681 miles away

On the taxi ride to our hotel, and after trying to greet us in at least three different languages, our charming driver made the first of what would be a few comments that made me feel at home:

>You don't speak Papiamento? I thought you were a native!

Upon explaining to him that, no, I was just there visiting, he again commented on how much I would fit in with the locals. He wasn't the only one to make such comments, but he was the first and I charish that.
